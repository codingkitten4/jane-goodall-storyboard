# Abbreviations inside the code
qCard means question card, and eCard means enlarged card.

# Reasons for with-vue and without-vue
I first tried to write this application without using any framework, however, I found it too hard and gave up. Instead, I started to use Vue, but only for the eCard and qCard things. Before this project, the only web development I had done was with ASP.NET, which runs on .NET. However, I preserved the original application (the one without Vue) because I hoped someone would fork the code and make it a substitute for the one with vue.

# Done
The project is now done, but I hope someone will be able to fork the code and recreate the project without using Vue.
